# Automated Data Analysis with AI

Welcome to the **Automated Data Analysis** project! This script leverages the power of GPT-4o-Mini and data science techniques to analyze datasets, generate insightful narratives, and produce stunning visualizations—all in a fully automated process. By combining machine learning, statistical methods, and advanced visualization tools, the script provides deep insights into any dataset you feed it.

## What is this Project About?

The goal of this project is to automate data analysis using cutting-edge AI technology. The script analyzes data from various CSV datasets, automatically generating the following:

- **Descriptive Statistics**: A detailed overview of the dataset, including its structure, column types, and missing values.
- **AI-Powered Narrative**: A narrative analysis generated by GPT-4o-Mini, offering insights, trends, and interpretations based on the data.
- **Visualizations**: Stunning visualizations in PNG format, including heatmaps, correlation matrices, and distribution histograms, that help bring the data to life.

The best part? All of this happens with a single command.

## How It Works

### Step 1: Run the Script
The core of this project is a Python script called `autolysis.py`. By running this script with any CSV dataset, you will automatically generate a **README.md** file containing a rich narrative and multiple data visualizations.

Here’s how to run the script:

```bash
uv run autolysis.py <dataset.csv>
